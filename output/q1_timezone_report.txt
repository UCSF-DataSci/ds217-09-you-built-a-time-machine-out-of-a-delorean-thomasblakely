Documentation of our timezone operations:

- What timezone was your original data in?
    a. Before we set a timezone, our data is in a 'naive' state/format. 
    This means that our data did not contain any timezone information at all. 
    In turn, a time like '09:00:00' could refer to a US Eastern timezone or even a US Western timezone. 
    We don't know.

- How did you localize the data?
    a. In order to localize our data, we use the 'tz_localize()' method and set our timezone to UTC, Coordinated Universal Time.
    We specifically localize our data here: patient_vitals_tz.index = patient_vitals_tz.index.tz_localize('UTC')

- What timezone did you convert to?
    a. We later converted our timezone from UTC to US Eastern using the 'tz_convert()' method.
    We specifically convert our data here: patient_vitals_tz_eastern.index = patient_vitals_tz_eastern.tz_convert('US/Eastern') 
    Note that because we did not want to get rid of our UTC-localized data, we created a new eastern-focused DataFrame for patient vitals.


- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
    a. While DST (Daylight Saving Time) would normally be an issue with time data, due to 'fall back' and 'spring forward' leading to time ambiguity, we did not face any issues.
    The reason for this is because UTC remains constant year-round, avoiding DST entirely.
    In turn, conversion to other timezones, like US Eastern, can be easily made afterwards without any timezone/DST hassle.


- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion
    a. An example of datetime conversion before and after conversion, following DST transition time:
    UTC: 2023-03-12 10:00:00+00:00
    Eastern: 2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00

- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data
    a.  UTC is recommended as a base timezone for storing temporal data because it is a singular, universally accepted time format that helps avoid complications that arise from timezones and DST.
